## 🧠 About the Project

This AI-powered chatbot simulates the behavior of a real professional career counselor. It listens patiently, adapts to the user's preferred language (English, Hindi, Marathi, Hinglish, etc.), and guides them step-by-step to:

- Identify strengths, interests, and goals
- Discover aligned career paths
- Get concrete roadmaps and learning plans
- Make confident career decisions

It uses a *"one-question-at-a-time"* approach to avoid overwhelming users and build trust, just like human mentors do.
